This is an early deployment to test basic game functionality.
You can try the game here: https://qweuser.github.io/cebelca/

## Known bugs

1. The page currently uses css scale property to work on different devices. This causes bad pixel rounding, so some elements like borders, underlines etc. are not displayed properly.

## Missing features

1. Bee animation on intro screen and game screen
2. Bee proverbs on bee icon click.
