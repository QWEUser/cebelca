This is an early deployment to test basic game functionality.

## Known bugs

1. The page currently uses css scale property to work on different devices. This causes bad pixel rounding, so some elements like borders, underlines etc. are not displayed properly.
2. Dark mode background issues on smaller devices.

## Missing features

1. Daily game.
2. Saving current game progress to local storage.
3. Bee animation on intro screen and game screen
4. Bee proverbs on bee icon click.
5. display current full jar score.
